A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. Here are some key concepts and types of binary trees:

Key Concepts
Node: Each element of a binary tree.
Root: The top node of the tree.
Parent: A node that has branches to other nodes.
Child: A node that is a descendant of another node.
Leaf: A node that does not have any children.
Subtree: A tree consisting of a node and its descendants.
Depth: The number of edges from the root to the node.
Height: The number of edges on the longest path from a node to a leaf.
Types of Binary Trees
Full Binary Tree: Every node has either 0 or 2 children.
Complete Binary Tree: All levels are fully filled except possibly for the last level, which is filled from left to right.
Perfect Binary Tree: All interior nodes have two children, and all leaves are at the same level.
Balanced Binary Tree: The height of the tree is O(log n), where n is the number of nodes.
Binary Search Tree (BST): For each node, the left subtree contains only nodes with keys less than the node’s key, and the right subtree contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
Degenerate (or Pathological) Tree: Each parent node has only one child. This structure is essentially a linked list.
Traversal Methods
In-Order Traversal (Left, Root, Right): Visits all nodes in ascending order for BST.
Pre-Order Traversal (Root, Left, Right): Useful for creating a copy of the tree.
Post-Order Traversal (Left, Right, Root): Useful for deleting a tree.
Level-Order Traversal: Visits nodes level by level from left to right.
Binary Search Tree (BST)
A binary search tree is a binary tree with the additional condition that for each node, all nodes in its left subtree have keys less than the node's key, and all nodes in its right subtree have keys greater than the node's key.

Operations
Insertion: Insert a new node into the BST while maintaining the BST property.
Deletion: Remove a node from the BST while maintaining the BST property.
Search: Find a node with a given key.
Data Structures: Binary Tree
Binary trees are fundamental in computer science and are used in various applications, including searching, sorting, and representing hierarchical data. They provide an efficient way to store and manipulate data with hierarchical relationships.
